# Challenge #2: Determinant

## 1

The determinant of B is 42.

## 2

The file exercise_2.rb is a solution.

## 3

Assuming that the number of multiplications a cpu can do is on the same order of their frequency, a 1 GHz processor can
execute approximately 10⁹ multiplications per second.

The number of multiplications needed for calculating the determinant of an nxn matrix is:

$$\sum_{k=1}^{n}\frac{n!}{k!}$$

Then, for calculating the determinant of a 100*100 matrix, the cpu must perform approximately 15.462 * 10¹⁵⁷ multiplications. For
a 3.7 GHz processor, that means 15.462 * 10¹⁴⁸ seconds. That is almost 4.8 * 10¹⁴³ days. This number is greater than googol. In fact,
it's greater than the number of elementary particles in the known universe.
